# Regular-expression-parser-and-evaluator
This project, a Regular Expression Parser and Evaluator, breaks down regex evaluation into three stages: tokenization, parse tree construction, and NFA-based matching. It converts regex patterns into tokens, builds syntax trees, and uses a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) for string matching. The tool provides an interactive web interface for educational purposes in formal language theory and compiler construction.
