# Regular-expression-parser-and-evaluator
This project is a regular expression parser and evaluator that generates tokens, parse trees, and finite automata from regular expression patterns. It matches strings against regex patterns by constructing a parse tree and automaton, enabling efficient pattern matching and evaluation for complex string-processing tasks.
